DAVM specifications

- Interpreted bytecode, 3 address instructions
- 16 registers, signed 32 bits. Reg #15 is stack pointer.
- Memory: 2^32 addressable bytes in 4k pages. Unit of memory accesses is 32 bit words.
Mem operations work only on 4 bytes words aligned to 4.
-Code and data reside in different memory spaces. Thus memory access depends on if
we want to access data or code.


While data memory is indexed in bytes, code memory is indexed as 32bits words.
(if code was to reside in data memory, they should both be indexed by bytes)
