A parsing error is whenever we don't find the token we are expecting.
Whenever a parsing error is found different strategies are used.
The goal is to parse the rule as completely as possible, and
hopefully complete parsing of the whole input. Because then we will have
a valid AST which can then be context analyzed to try and find more errors.

Strategy 1: Ignore missing token.
This can be applied for purely syntactic tokens such as a comma that
separates variables declarations.
This is done only if the current token is the next we would expect.

Strategy 2: Ignore current token until we get the one we expect.

Strategy 3: Ignore all tokens until a synchronizing token.
This is the fail-safe option, where we can produce an empty derivation for the
current token.
