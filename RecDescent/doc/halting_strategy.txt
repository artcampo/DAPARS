BaseParser provides the function ContinueParsing() which is false whenever
-NextToken has been advanced when current token was already eof.
-The amount of errors surpasses k.

This function is not called for each non-terminal, instead it's called for:
-key non-terminals (stmts, stmt)
-before any error recover action that could go infinite

It is specifically not called for the most frequent non-terminals such as
expression or binary ops.

Integrity of AST: Fatal errors within a non-terminal force pointers to be
nullptr. Any node creation that takes another node checks for a nullptr, and
in such case also sets current node to nullptr. This avoids nodes having
children and in the extreme case of an AST with no valid nodes, the root
itself is nullptr.
