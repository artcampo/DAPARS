These are the tests that cover the different components of the compiler.
They are self-contained and they cover many different cases (up to 50).

-RecDescent/src/tests/test_grammar_dalang.cpp
Checks that the grammar has no left recursion or ambiguities.

-RecDescent/src/tests/test_errors_parser.cpp
Checks different scenarios of parsing/semantics message errors.

-RecDescent/src/tests/test_parser.cpp
Checks parsing, AST construction, scopes and variable declarations.

-RecDescent/src/tests/test_ir_generator.cpp
Checks IR generation

-RecDescent/src/tests/test_backend_davm.cpp
Checks the backend generator for test_backend_davm


These tests take input files, and as such depend

-RecDescent/src/tests/test_parser_compiler_davm.cpp
Given a source file produces bytecode for DAVM
